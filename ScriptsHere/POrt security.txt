list all open ports:
				 netstat -lntu (same use as the below)
				 
look for ports:  ss -tl (tcp)
				 ss -ul (udp)    or both
	filter:
		ss -ul | grep LISTEN
		
find service and it port:
				ss -tuln (-n port number listening) | grep LISTEN
				
	CLOSE open poen:
			sudo ss -tulnp (-p for name of service)
			
			to close:
				sudo service "service name" stop
				or
				sudo systemctl "service name"

look at the iptable rules like so:
				/etc/iptable.conf
				

look for the fire wall used:

				sudo which nft >/dev/null && echo nftables is enabled in this system || echo ufw is enabled in this system
				
					if it is anabled then add the following to config file:
							located at : /etc/nftables.conf
						  do this: 
						  
						  chain inbound {
							...
							tcp dport "(port or ports to be enabled sep by ",")" accept
						  }

to deny remote access:
			sudo which nft >/dev/null && echo nftables is enabled in this system || echo ufw is enabled in this system
			
			to close port:
				sudo ufw deny "port number"
