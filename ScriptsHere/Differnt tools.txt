Crypto Enegma:

We are to have a logic of using the tools and this tools should be used in giver order to solve the challenges
One: Identify the cipher with one or more of this tools
1. https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier
2. in kali use command hashid -m "hashString Or file path"
Then to solove use this tools:
1. hashcat -m hashid "hashString or file path" pathToWordList 
2. Or use following online tools: 
a) https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ (CyberChef)
b. https://www.dcode.fr/
